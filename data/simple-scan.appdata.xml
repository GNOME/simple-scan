      A really easy way to scan both documents and photos.
      You can crop out the bad parts of a photo and rotate it if it is the wrong way round.
      You can print your scans, export them to pdf, or save them in a range of image formats.

      Simple Scan uses the SANE framework to support most existing scanners.
