# Introduction

This is the source code to *Simple Scan* â€” a [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/)
document scanning application. Simple Scan allows you to capture images using
[image scanners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scanner) (e.g. flatbed
scanners) that have suitable [SANE drivers](http://sane-project.org/) installed.

# Building from source

Install the dependencies (first line is Ubuntu/Debian, second is Fedora):
```
$ sudo apt install git meson valac libgtk-3-dev libgusb-dev libcolord-dev libpackagekit-glib2-dev libwebp-dev libsane-dev gettext itstool
```
```
$ sudo dnf install -y meson vala gettext itstool gtk3-devel libgusb-devel colord-devel PackageKit-glib-devel libwebp-devel sane-backends-devel
```

Get the source:
```
$ git clone https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/simple-scan.git
$ cd simple-scan
```

Build and run:
```
$ meson --prefix $PWD/install build/
$ ninja -C build/ all install
$ XDG_DATA_DIRS=install/share:$XDG_DATA_DIRS ./install/bin/simple-scan
```

# Debugging

There is a --debug command line switch to enable more verbose logging:
```
$ simple-scan --debug
```

Log messages can also be found in the `$HOME/.cache/simple-scan` folder.

If you don't have a scanner ready, you can use a virtual "test" scanner:
```
$ simple-scan --debug test
```

Simple Scan works by using the [SANE API](http://sane-project.org/html/) to
capture images. It chooses the settings it thinks are appropriate for what you
are trying to do. Drivers have many options and are of differring quality - it
is useful to work out if any issues are caused by Simple Scan or the drivers. To
rule out Simple Scan you can use the graphical tool (XSane) or the
command line
[scanimage](http://www.sane-project.org/man/scanimage.1.html) provided
by the SANE project - these allow to to easily see and control all the
settings your driver provides.
