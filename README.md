# Introduction

*Document Scanner* is a document scanning application for [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/)
It allows you to capture images using [image scanners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scanner)
(e.g. flatbed scanners) that have suitable [SANE drivers](http://sane-project.org/) installed.

# Building from source

Install the dependencies

For Ubuntu/Debian:
```
$ sudo apt install git meson valac libgtk-3-dev libgusb-dev libcolord-dev libpackagekit-glib2-dev libwebp-dev libsane-dev gettext itstool
```

For Fedora:
```
$ sudo dnf install -y meson vala gettext itstool gtk3-devel libgusb-devel colord-devel PackageKit-glib-devel libwebp-devel sane-backends-devel
```

Get the source:
```
$ git clone https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/simple-scan.git
$ cd simple-scan
```

Build and run:
```
$ meson --prefix $PWD/install build/
$ ninja -C build/ all install
$ XDG_DATA_DIRS=install/share:$XDG_DATA_DIRS ./install/bin/simple-scan
```

# Debugging

There is a `--debug` command line switch to enable more verbose logging:
```
$ simple-scan --debug
```

Log messages can also be found in the `$HOME/.cache/simple-scan` folder.

If you don't have a scanner ready, you can use a virtual `test` scanner:
```
$ simple-scan --debug test
```

This app works by using the [SANE API](http://sane-project.org/html/) to
capture images. It chooses the settings it thinks are appropriate for what you
are trying to do. Drivers have many options and are of differing quality - it
is useful to work out if any issues are caused by the app or the drivers. To
confirm it is a driver issue you can use the graphical tool (XSane) or the
command line
[scanimage](http://www.sane-project.org/man/scanimage.1.html) provided
by the SANE project - these allow to to easily see and control all the
settings your driver provides.

If XSane is also not working, then the issue could be casued by wrongly
loaded backend. To enable debug traces on Sane, set `SANE_DEBUG_DLL`
environment variable:

```
$ export SANE_DEBUG_DLL=255
```

When set, SANE backends will show informational messages while
*Document Scanner* is running

Example:

With HP MFP 135a scanner, there is missing `libusb-0.1.so.4`
shared library, during loading `smfp` prioprietary backend:

```
[dll] sane_get_devices
[dll] load: searching backend `smfp' in `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane:/usr/lib/sane'
[dll] load: trying to load `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-smfp.so.1'
[dll] load: couldn't open `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-smfp.so.1' (No such file or directory)
[dll] load: trying to load `/usr/lib/sane/libsane-smfp.so.1'
[dll] load: dlopen()ing `/usr/lib/sane/libsane-smfp.so.1'
[dll] load: dlopen() failed (libusb-0.1.so.4: No such file or directory)
```
